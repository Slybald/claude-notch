## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-19

First public release.

### Added

- Notch panel that tracks Claude Code sessions from the CLI (terminals, editors) and from the Code tab of
  Claude Desktop, fed by async hooks relayed to a local server on `127.0.0.1:47823`.
- Session states: ready, thinking, running a tool, waiting for permission, waiting for an answer, plan to
  review, done, error, compacting; sessions that need you are listed first.
- Collapsed notch with two ears: overall state on the left, `sessions·subagents` (e.g. `1·6`) or task
  progress on the right.
- Permission details (command, file, question), task list progress, running subagents per session.
- Click on a card: brings the host app to the front, or opens the exact session in Claude Desktop.
- Optional tools section: recent files written by Claude, Git status, today's usage.
- Local logs of written files and permission requests in `~/Library/Application Support/ClaudeNotch/`.
- First-launch window that installs the hooks (backup of `settings.json`, existing hooks kept, key order
  preserved), and an uninstall command in the **…** menu (**Uninstall Claude Notch…**).
- Interface in English and French, following the system language.
- Migration from early builds (`local.claudenotch`): the new version replaces the running one and keeps
  the "open at login" setting.
- Universal app (Apple silicon and Intel), macOS 13 or later, distributed as a DMG built by GitHub Actions
  from version tags.
